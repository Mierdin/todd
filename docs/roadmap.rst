Roadmap
================================

Goals for Alpha Release

* Store group-to-group aggreagate test data as a graph (agent groups are the lowest addressable node in teh graph)
* Consider getting rid of YAML files. It should be easy to run tests using a one-liner (native testlets should have reasonable defaults) or they just run on their own in the background
* Simplify agent setup. Is there a way to provide configuration-less agent setup?
* Need to look at modifying ToDD to run tests in a hands-off way. Think about the inspiration from the vendors at NFD12. Need to rethink the execution of tests. You know you can store test results without server connectivity, but can you run tests without server connectivity?
